# Superior Development General License

### License Overview

The Superior Development & DarthCraft projects are all based from the [MIT](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT) license. This gives you the general freedom to do what you wish with the project. All Java based plugins are derived of the Spigot server software and the respective license applies to that project. 

We do however require that you follow some additional restrictions when you are using our projects regardless of the language the software is written in or the authors. These are as follows:

### Commercial Usage

Commercial usage or any form of sale of this plugin is expressly forbidden. You may not sell the software as a project, nor may you compile the source code (where applicable) / link to the project using any form of adfly links or similar where you will gain profit from users clicking the links. All link backs should be using a service that will not gain you any profits (Like Pravius).

### Distribution 

You may distribute any plugins in any way you feel fit (Providing they comply with the [commercial usage](#commercial-usage) regulations). You are however not permitted to remove any sort of credits from within the software. This includes but is not limited to:

 - Ryan Wild
 - Jeorm Sar
 - Wild1145
 - DarthSalamon

We also require you link users back to our official releases. These can be found at the following template: Github.com/organisation/Project-Name/releases  Failing to link users to the official releases is in strict violation of this license and appropriate action will be taken. 

### Other Conditions

Individual projects may be sub-licensed in addition to this license, or as a replacement as such a license. If this is the case you will find a LICENCE.md included within the project source. That license will explain any additional restrictions or if it is a total replacement of this license.

### License Waived

This license and any other sub-licenses for the project may be waived at the discretion of the Superior Development project lead (Currently Ryan Wild). No other developers have the ability to waive this or other licenses to individuals or businesses. We may also choose to waive certain parts of the license and this is again at the discretion of the project lead at Superior Development. A full list of waived individuals / businesses will be listed below including the extent to the license being waived.

#### Waived Users:

At the current time there are no individuals or businesses that the license has been waived to.
